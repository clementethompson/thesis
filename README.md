## Very Short-Term Active And Reactive Load Forecasting Based On Complex-Valued LSTM Neural Network

Hi, this was supposed to be my thesis project for an MSc. Eng. in Electrical Engineering. For a number of reasons I was not able to finish the degree. However, I would like to share my work. This is not published or peer reviewed in any way.

Acknowldegements to the SimBench team for their datasets and tools.
